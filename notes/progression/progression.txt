maybe divide the story by chapters??
who knows


BEGGINING CUTSCENE

the beggining cutscene is plain text saying:

TODO: write some cryptic shit here

"I know you are not cognitive"
"but I know that... deep inside..."
"you still have a soul"
"a soul that can understand"
"I'm no engineer"
"I'm no electrician"
"...I just want a better future for ourselves..."


the meaning: a little human girl is 'putting you back together' (crazy fnaf reference), fixing your hardware, in the hopes of you helping her or whatever
then:
a slow fade




the game starts with a cutscene of HH looking through trash to find scrap electronics, he doesn't find it
a new quest is given "find scrap electronics"
after looking around in the cave and getting the item
a quest says to go home,
HH uses the scrap electronics to fix a computer.


looking around, in the cave system, HH finds a little girl, seemingly lost.
she tells you she lives in the small village you find at the beginning of the game


"you don't seem too talkative"
"but i know you have a soul in you"
"all of you do"
"even the red ones..."
